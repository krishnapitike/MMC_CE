Run $python3 metropolis_RP_MEMC2.py
Energy distribution, short range order parameters as a function of Temperature and Oxygen partial pressure can be computed.
atat code needs to be precompiled and the cluster expansion model predetermined to run the metropolis monte carlo simulation using this code.
This repository contains the following files.
1) metropolis_RP_MEMC2.py -> Metropolis Montecarlo code to compute the short range ordering up to third nearest neighbor. 
   The energy is obtained by running atat based cluster expansion code. The cluster expansion code requires the following input files.
2) clusters.out -> input file for cluster expansion code containing the information of clusters
3) control.in   -> input file for cluster expansion code containing the temperature and number of steps - set to 0 and 0
4) eci.out      -> input file for cluster expansion code containing the energies of the clusters
5) gs_str.out   -> input file for cluster expansion code containing the information of clusters
6) lat.in       -> input file for cluster expansion code containing one unit cell structure and chemical composition
7) str.out      -> copy of strInit.out
8) strInit.out  -> input file for cluster expansion code containing super cell structure
